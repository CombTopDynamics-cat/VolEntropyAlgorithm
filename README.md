# VolEntropyAlgorithm
This repository contains the MAPLE procedure to compute the Volume Entropy
of geometric presentations of surface groups trough a dynamical approach
developed in [Alsedà et al. 2025].

The dynamical aproach consists in computing the topological entropy of the
Bowen-Series-like maps (a family of discontinuous maps on the circle)  
using the Milnor-Thurston theory for one dimensional maps.

The topological entropy of the Bowen-Series-like maps coincides with
the volume entropy of the group as proved in [Alsedà et al. 2025]
